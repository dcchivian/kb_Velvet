# Configure the display and description of parameters

parameters :
    read_libraries :
        ui-name : Read Libraries
        short-hint : Read libraries (only KBase PairedEnd Libs are input through this parameter)
    hash_length :
        ui-name : hash_length 
        short-hint : |
            An integer for length of hash
    output_contigset_name :
        ui-name : |
            Output ContigSet
        short-hint : |
            The name for the resulting ContigSet will be saved in KBase
    min_contig_length :
        ui-name : |
            Minimal contig length
        short-hint : |
            The shortest contig to accept in the resulting assembly object
    cov_cutoff :
        ui-name : |
            cov_cutoff
        short-hint : |
            removal of low coverage nodes AFTER tour bus or allow the system to infer it when set it to 'auto' 
        long-hint : |
            removal of low coverage nodes AFTER tour bus, it can also be set automatically to half the length weighted median contig coverage depth
    ins_length :
        ui-name : |
            ins_length
        short-hint : |
            expected distance between two paired end reads (default: no read pairing)
    read_trkg :
        ui-name : |
            track short read positions
        short-hint : |
            tracking of short read positions in assembly (default: no tracking)
    amos_file :
        ui-name : |
            export AMOS file
        short-hint : |
            export assembly to AMOS file (default: no export)
    exp_cov :
        ui-name : |
            expected coverage
        short-hint : |
            expected short-read k-mer coverage of unique regions or allow the system to infer it when set it to 'auto'
        long-hint : |
            <p>A value of 'auto' will set exp cov to the length weighted median contig coverage, and cov cutoff to half that value (unless you override it with a manual setting), it can also be set automatically to half the length weighted median contig coverage depth.</p>
    long_cov_cutoff :
        ui-name : |
            long_cov_cutoff
        short-hint : |
            removal of nodes with low long-read coverage AFTER tour bus (default: no removal)

    <p>This is a KBase wrapper for Velvet.</p>
    <p>Velvet is a classic de-bruijn graph based assembler. Velvet works by efficiently manipulating de Bruijn graphs through simplification and compression. It eliminates errors and resolves repeats by first using an error correction algorithm that merges sequences together. Repeats are then removed from the sequence via the repeat solver that separates paths which share local overlaps. Velvet is fast and robust, although it is no longer in active development.</p>
    <p><b>NOTE that Velvet is not deterministic</b> See https://www.biostars.org/p/86907/ and https://www.researchgate.net/post/Does_velvet_generate_different_assemblies_from_the_same_input_data_and_same_velvet_parameters</p>
    <p><b>Known limitations</b>: Velvet assembly quality is known to be sensitive to the hash length.</p>
